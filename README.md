ðŸ”¬ Geometric Hashing-Based Protein Structure Search

This project aims to efficiently store, index, and retrieve 3D protein structures using geometric hashing and SVD-based feature compression.
It allows rapid querying of structurally similar proteins from a dataset by computing key geometric features from CÎ± coordinates.
